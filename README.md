This product idea implements Hidden Markov Models to build a basic English sentence recognizer. Different parts of grammar (ie. subject, predicate, object, and auxiliary) are identified by the program as well as the probability of a possible sentence that could be created from a given library of words. This program could be useful tool for users learning different languages. This is a representative of my knowledge in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and the notion that with a big enough data sets, in my case, words library, the computer could gain “intelligence” to output meaningful and useful results.
